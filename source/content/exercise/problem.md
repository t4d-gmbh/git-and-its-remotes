## Weekend out on Git[Hub/Lab] - Part 2 <i class="fa-solid fa-person-hiking"></i>

Welcome back to our “Weekend Out” project!

In the first part, we started planning our weekend trip and got familiar with the basics of Git. 
Now, it’s time to dive deeper and build on what we’ve learned. 
In this second part, we’ll continue working on our project, **focusing on features that are offered by remote hosting services like GitHub or GitLab**, and how they can enhance (a collaborative) workflow.

Please follow the instructions in the README file of the “Weekend Out” repository for the next set of exercises. 
You can find the repository and all related materials at the following link:

Let’s continue our journey and make this weekend trip plan even better.
