# Exercise

Welcome back to our “<i class="fa-solid fa-person-hiking"></i> Weekend Out” project!

In the first part, we started planning our weekend trip and familiarized ourselves with the basics of Git. 
Now, it’s time to dive deeper and build on what we’ve learned. 
In this second part, we’ll focus on the **features offered by remote hosting services like GitHub or GitLab**, and how they can enhance  collaborative workflows.

Please follow the instructions in the README file of the “Weekend Out” repository for the next set of exercises. 
You can find the repository and all related materials at the following link:

Let’s continue our journey and improve our weekend trip planning!
