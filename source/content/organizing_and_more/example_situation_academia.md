## Possible Challenges Faced by Research Groups

Imagine a research group at a university, bustling with brilliant minds and groundbreaking ideas. 
However, their collaboration is hindered by a chaotic workflow. 
Emails are overflowing with attachments, version control is a nightmare, and crucial updates are often lost in the shuffle. 
Team members frequently overwrite each otherâ€™s work or share code snippets by email, leading to frustration and wasted time.

Tasks are managed haphazardly, with no clear system to track progress or assign responsibilities. 
Important milestones are missed, and the lack of standardized documentation of implementations or even ideas makes it difficult for new members to get up to speed and can lead to knowledge drain when team members leave.
Data integrity is compromised, and integrating contributions from different team members is a constant struggle.
