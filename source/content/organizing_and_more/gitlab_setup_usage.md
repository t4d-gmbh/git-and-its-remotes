### **GitLab**'s Organization Structure in Action

In an academic context, **GitLab**'s organizational structure can be leveraged to streamline collaboration and project management.
Here's how it might look:

- **Group Creation**: Your university's research lab could create a Group on **GitLab** to host various research projects.
  Faculty members could be assigned the role of Owners of the Group, overseeing the projects and managing access.

- **Sub-Group Formation**: Create Subgroups within the main Group for different research areas or projects.
  Each Subgroup would have access to specific repositories based on their roles and responsibilities.
  This structure is useful for managing permissions and collaboration within the lab.
  For example, a Subgroup for a specific research project could have its own dedicated repositories.

- **Repository Management**: Each research project could have its own repository within the relevant Subgroup (or multiple repositories).
  These repositories could contain code, data, manuscripts, and other project-related files.
  By using repositories, you can maintain version control, track changes, and collaborate effectively on research projects.

- **Progress Tracking**: Track the research project's progress using Issues, issue boards (which can aggregate all Issues in a Subgroup), and Merge Requests within the repositories.
  This would help in managing tasks, tracking Milestones, and reviewing contributions from team members.

### Collaborating with External Partners

Invite collaborators to specific Projects or Subgroups within the Group, enabling them to contribute to a project.
This can be particularly useful when working with industry partners, other research groups, or open-source communities.
