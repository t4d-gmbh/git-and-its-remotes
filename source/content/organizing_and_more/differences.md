| Feature                     | GitHub                                      | GitLab                                      |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Access Control**          | Managed through teams and repository settings | Managed through groups and sub-groups      |
| **Permission Levels**       | Read, Triage, Write, Maintain, Admin       | Guest, Reporter, Developer, Maintainer, Owner |
| **Inheritance**             | Permissions can be inherited from organization-level settings | Sub-groups inherit permissions from parent groups, but cannot revoke them |
| **Additional Rights**       | Can assign different permissions to teams   | Can grant additional rights in sub-groups   |
| **Milestones and Boards**   | Milestones are repository-specific; no built-in Kanban | Sub-groups can own milestones and create issue boards |

## Summary
- GitHub focuses on team-based access control, while GitLab emphasizes group and sub-group structures.
- GitLab offers more granular control over milestones and Kanban boards at the sub-group level.
