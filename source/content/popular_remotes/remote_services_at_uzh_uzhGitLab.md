## [UZH GitLab Server](https://gitlab.uzh.ch/)

### Requirements
This service requires a SWITCH edu-ID linked to your UZH-AAI identity:
- If you don't have a SWITCH edu-ID, create one with the "Create with AAI" option and link it to your AAI account.
- If your SWITCH edu-ID is not yet linked to your UZH-AAI identity, do this after logging in to your edu-ID (under Linked Identities).

### External Users
External users must also register for a SWITCH edu-ID and log into the UZH GitLab server with this ID:
- External users (those whose SWITCH edu-ID is not linked to a UZH-AAI identity) are marked as external in GitLab and must be invited to projects.
- External users cannot create projects themselves.
