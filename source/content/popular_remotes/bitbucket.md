## Bitbucket

Bitbucket is a platform for hosting and managing code repositories, with a strong focus on integration with Atlassian tools like Jira[^sn1] and Confluence[^sn2]. It supports Git and Mercurial version control systems and offers features for collaboration, issue tracking, and CI/CD workflows. Founded in 2008, Bitbucket is part of the Atlassian suite of products, making it a popular choice for teams already using Atlassian tools.

**Pros:**
- Strong integration with Atlassian tools (Jira, Confluence)
- Supports both Git and Mercurial
- Comprehensive CI/CD with Bitbucket Pipelines

**Cons:**
