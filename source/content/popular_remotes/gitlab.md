## GitLab <i class="fab fa-gitlab"></i>

GitLab is a popular, open-source platform for hosting and managing code repositories, offering comprehensive DevOps features for collaboration, issue tracking, and CI/CD workflows. 
Founded in 2011, GitLab is compared to GitHub fully open-source and provides a similar feature set that supports the entire software development lifecycle but has a stronger focus on self-hosted and on-premise installations.

**Pros:**
- Open-source platform
- Comprehensive DevOps features
- Strong CI/CD integration

**Cons:**
- Can be complex to set up and manage
- Some advanced features require a paid plan

**Self-Managed Version:**
GitLab offers a self-managed version that allows organizations to host their repositories on-premise or in the cloud, providing greater control over security and compliance.
