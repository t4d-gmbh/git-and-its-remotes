## Feature Branch Approach - _reloaded_
{% if page %}
Now that we know some of the [Collaboration Tools](./../../remote_service_features/collaboration_tools/index.md#collaboration-tools)  <i class="fab fa-git"></i> remotes services provide, we can revise the [✨Feature✨ Branch Approach](https://t4d-gmbh.github.io/working-with-git/content/feature_branch/index.html) from our course [working-with-git](https://t4d-gmbh.github.io/working-with-git/).

Let us quickly recall that a "Feature Branch" is a <i class="fab fa-git"></i> branch dedicated for the implementation of a distinct functionality, attribute, or similar and it should be intuitively clear that a collaborative context requires some form of documentation for the feature itself and ideally for the process of its implementation, as well.

In addition, some remote services also provide contextual triggers between some of their collaborative tools and the associated <i class="fab fa-git"></i> repository (and vice-versa), setting up a context in which:

The life-cycle of a feature branch can be managed entirely through the remote service.
