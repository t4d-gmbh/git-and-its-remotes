## Exemplary workflow

1. **Open an issue**: Person 1 (team member, community user) notices a bug or wants to propose a new feature and opens an issue with a compelling title and a detailed description. 
1. **Discussion**: Other team members or users discuss potential fixes or features in the comments
1. **Assign & Work**: someone is assigned (or assign themselves) the issue, and they start working on it either preparing a single commit or creating a separate <i class="fab fa-git"></i> branch. 
1. **Comment & Link**: Progress can regularly be reported by commenting by tagging the issue directly in a commit message.
1. Close the issue: Once the code is reviewed and merged, the issue is closed.
