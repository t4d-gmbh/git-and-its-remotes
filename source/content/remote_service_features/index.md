# Remote Services

{% if page %}
As we discussed in Part 1, <i class="fab fa-git"></i> is a distributed version control system (VCS) that manages and tracks change in codebases located locally (i.e. on your machine).
<i class="fab fa-git"></i> is not to be confused with <i class="fab fa-github"></i> **GitHub** and <i class="fab fa-gitlab"></i> **GitLab**, or similar, which, in turn, are remote hosting web-based platforms that use <i class="fab fa-git"></i> to offer services to store and collaborate on code remotely.

Remote services like **GitHub** or **GitLab** offer a range of features that extend beyond basic <i class="fab fa-git"></i> functionalities, making project management, collaborations and automation that much easier.
In this section, we will go over some of the key features of <i class="fab fa-git"></i>-based remote services and tools that are particularly useful for project management.
