#### Activity Tracking

:::{admonition} A {octicon}`git-pull-request;0.8em` News Feed {math}`\neq` <i class="fab fa-git"></i> history
:class: warning, margin

Activity-tracking is a feature of remote service platforms {%if page %}such as <i class="fab fa-github"></i> **GitHub** and <i class="fab fa-gitlab"></i> **GitLab**, {% endif %}and not a <i class="fab fa-git"></i> concept itself.
"News Feeds" might contain parts of the <i class="fab fa-git"></i> history, but not vice-versa.
:::
{% if slide %}
GitHub, GitLab, and other platforms offer activity tracking as part of their services to provide a full history of what happened, when it happened, and why it happened.
{% else %}
One of the key services offered by  <i class="fab fa-github"></i>GitHub,  <i class="fab fa-gitlab"></i>GitLab, and other platforms, is tracking and providing a full record in an organized way of all the changes beyond the commits history provided in <i class="fab fa-git"></i>.
It's much more than just keeping a list of changes, it includes a full history of what happened, when it happened, and why it happened. 

Tracking activities is available both for {octicon}`issue-opened;0.8em` Issues and {octicon}`git-pull-request;0.8em` Merge/Pull Requests and is reported in the attached "News Feed" that can also be used for commenting.
Despite the automated activity tracking it is also possible to manually create links between Issues and/or Pull/Merge Requests simply by pasting their URL as a comment in some News Feed. 

By means of this automated tracking, the complete life-cycle is documented which can drastically facilitate collaboration and documentation, as these "News Feeds" effectively turn into a digital logbook.

Key advantages:

1. **Clarity and Transparency**: understand what has been done in a repository, why and by whom, even after months or years.
{% if page %}
   Every time something in the project is changed GitHub/GitLab records:
    
   - What changed, i.e. the actual lines of code;
   - Why it changed through issue tracking and pull requests:
   - Who changed it
{% endif %}
1. **Accountability and Responsibility**: tracking who made changes and why makes it easier and faster to address problems.

1. **Collaboration and Communication**: the full history of changes ensures everyone is on the same page{% if page %}, even in teams working remotely or in different time zones.
The Pull/Merge Request system encourages discussions and reviews within a team or a wider community{% endif %}. 

1. **Continuous learning and preventing mistakes**: with a record of every issue, change, and discussion, new users or future developers can look back and learn why certain decisions were made{% if page %}, what worked and what didnâ€™t, or how similar problem were solved, which in turn allows for better informed decision-making in the future{% endif %}.

1. **Gather Contextual Information**: extending <i class="fab fa-git"></i> with contextual information facilitates the identification of a previous healthy state or breaking changes in dependencies{% if page %} thus making it easier to recover from mistakes, quickly identify or even prevent bugs introduced by external changes{% endif %}.

1. **Efficiency and Trust-Building**: keep track of an open discussion directly where the changes are made, makes it easier to find information and builds trust{%if page %} (vs. long-chains of e-mails and endless meetings){% endif %}.
