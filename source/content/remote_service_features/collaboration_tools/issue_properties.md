What are the key properties of an issue and why are they useful for in collaborative project management?

1. Description: Each issue has a title and a a description section that outline the problem (expected and actual behaviour), task (e.g. steps to reproduce), or an enhancement (e.g. a new feature, potential ideas or solutions to fix a bug) to be made. 
2. Assignees: Issues can be assigned to specific team members to clarify tasks and responsibilities and facilitate project management. 
3. State: to track progress on an issue, they can have descriptive states like “open” (still to be resolved) and “closed” (issue has been resolved), or anything in between like “in progress”.
4. Labels: Issues can be categorised using labels, e.g. “bug”, “documentation”, etc., to help organise and prioritise work.
5. Comments: Team members can discuss an issue in a comment thread to offer insights, feedback, exchange ideas in how to resolve an issue.
6. Milestones: Issues can be grouped under specific milestones and follow the overarching structure of a project, e.g. timeline towards objectives, new version release.
