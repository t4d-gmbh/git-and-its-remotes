### Project Management Tools

- Milestones: organise related issues and merge / pull requests into milestones to plan releases or major project phases
- Task Lists: checkable items can be added to issues and merge/pull requests to better track progress within each individual task
-  Kanban-style Boards: to organise and visualise tasks according to their progress status, e.g . “To Do”, “In Progress”, “Done”. Issues and Pull/Merge Requests can be turned into tasks on these boards.
