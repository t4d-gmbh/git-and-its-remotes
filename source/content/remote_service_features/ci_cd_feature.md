### Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

{% if page %}
It is likely that you stumbled over the term ðŸŒŸCI/CDðŸŒŸ before, but it might not be very clear what this term actually means and why it should matter also for non-software developers.

In fact we consider it of such general relevance in the context of <i class="fab fa-git"></i> remote services that we dedicate an entire course, [ci-cd-workflows](https://github.com/t4d-gmbh/ci-cd-workflows) (or simply [Part 3](https://t4d-gmbh.github.io/using-git-in-academia/content/ci-cd-workflows/source/content/index.html)), in our series [using-git-in-academia](https://t4d-gmbh.github.io/using-git-in-academia/index.html) to this subject.

We recommend to follow [Part 3](https://t4d-gmbh.github.io/using-git-in-academia/content/ci-cd-workflows/source/content/index.html) to learn more about CI/CD, but in short:

**CI & CD both refer to automation procedures** that perform certain tasks whenever some events occur.

**Continuous Integration** relates to automated procedures, like tests, that are **triggered whenever some changes are to be integrated** into a repository.

**Continuous Deployment** (or sometimes **Delivery**) on the other hand refers to automated procedures that are run **whenever the content of a repository should be put to use**.
