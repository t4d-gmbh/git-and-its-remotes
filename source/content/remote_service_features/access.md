### Access Control
{% if page %}
This is a crucial feature remote services provide and is handled somewhat somewhat differently between remote service providers, unfortunately.

We will discuss this feature in some more detail in the section [Organizing Projects](../organizing_and_more/index.md#organizing-projects) but in short:
{% endif %}

Remote services like <i class="fab fa-gitlab"></i> GitLab and <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub, not only allow repository owners to grant access to hosted repositories, but they also offer:

- **fine-grained access control** over content, functions and actions,
- controlled **access at an organizational level** across multiple repositories,
- the ability to **further distribute access** rights,
- **protection for specific resources** (e.g protected `main` branch), and
- **automated access control** though integration with enterprise identity providers.
