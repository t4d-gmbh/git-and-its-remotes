### Access Control
{% if page %}
This is a crucial feature remote services provide and is handled somewhat somewhat differently between remotes, unfortunately.

We will discuss this feature in some more detail in the section [Oranizing Projects](../organizing_and_more/index.md#organizing-projects) but in short:
{% endif %}

Remote services like <i class="fab fa-gitlab"></i> GitLab and <i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub, do not just allow repository owners to give access to a repository they host, but they offer:

- **fine grained access control** to both content and functions or actions
- provide controlled **access on organisational levels** ranging over multiple repositories
- allow to **further distribute access** rights
- **protect certain resources** (e.g protected `main` branch)
