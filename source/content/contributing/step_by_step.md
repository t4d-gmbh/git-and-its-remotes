{% if page %}##### {% endif %}1. **Check Existing Issues** üëÄ{% if slide %} Check both {octicon}`issue-opened;0.8em` open and {octicon}`issue-closed;0.8em` closed Issues
{% else %} 
   - Browse existing Issues - {octicon}`issue-opened;0.8em` open and {octicon}`issue-closed;0.8em` closed ones - to see if the same or a similar Issue was already created.
   - If your Issue exists already, check for related Merge/Pull Requests and if they implement what you had in mind.
     If not, skip the next step (i.e. don't create a new {octicon}`issue-opened;0.8em` Issue) and simply proceed with step 3. **Read Documentation**.

     Bigger changes should be implemented in a separate branch following the feature branch approach, for example.
   - Follow the project's coding style and guidelines.
   - Make sure the branch on which you implement the changes, remains up to date with the target branch from to repository.

{% else %}
   - Once the Merge/Pull Request is merged or closed, feel free to delete your fork of the repository. This avoids confusion about which repository is the most up-to-date.
   - Continue to contribute to the project by helping with other issues or discussions.
