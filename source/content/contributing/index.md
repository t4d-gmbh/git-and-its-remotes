# Contributing to ðŸ”“ Open Source Repositories

{% if page %}
When using software â€” whether open source or proprietary â€” we often have ideas or opinions on how to improve it.
We might find certain aspects of the software or its documentation unclear, or we may spot typos and minor issues that we could easily fix ourselves.

Today is your lucky day!
You will learn just how simple it is to contribute to publicly hosted repositories on remote services like <i class="fab fa-github"></i> **GitHub** and <i class="fab fa-gitlab"></i> **GitLab**, so that next time when you stumble across some bug in some open-source project you actually can suggest your own fix.

In most cases external contributions follow a general workflow.

However, be sure to always consult the contribution guidelines of an open source <i class="fab fa-git"></i> repository.
